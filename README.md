### EndSars

A project implemented to extract and process tweets related to the `EndSARS` protests in Nigeria. A wordcloud is plotted from the most used words in the tweets and a sentiment analysis chart is also plotted to reflect the general opinion of the tweeters.

The `visualisation` can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/olufeyijimi.ayinde/viz/EndSARSAnalysis/Dashboard) and for more context, the `article` can be [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/endsars-protest-analysis-olufeyijimi-ayinde/?trackingId=ugvk4KbtRSufVOEcDd%2B8Bw%3D%3D)
